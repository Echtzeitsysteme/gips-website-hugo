**GIPS** is developed at the [Real-Time Systems Lab, TU Darmstadt](https://www.es.tu-darmstadt.de/en/) (TUDa).
You can find the list of contributors on the [GIPS developer page](../dev-team).

The source code of **GIPS** is available at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Echtzeitsysteme/gips) and it is based on [eMoflon::IBeX](https://emoflon.org/ibex/)


**GIPS**-specific development workspace set-up steps are available in the [README.md file](https://github.com/Echtzeitsysteme/gips#installation-development) of the [GIPS repository](https://github.com/Echtzeitsysteme/gips).
We recommend the usage of our [pre-built Eclipse application](../download/#pre-built-eclipse-application-gips) to start your development workspace.
